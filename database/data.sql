(1, 1, 'Is 5G The Next Big Threat To Our Bees?', 'Good news for cellphone users: 5G is here! But wait… it’s sinister, say Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, because it will make it possible for the Chinese to harvest our personal information, and it’s dangerous, say others, because its radiation will turn us all into three-headed zombies and kill insects and, in particular, the world’s bees.\r\nIn the interest of a rational look at this development we attempt to explain what it is, and whether it is harmful. In the telecommunications sphere, networks such as 5G (which means fifth generation), and 1, 2, 3 and 4G before it, are cellular networks, in which the service area covered is divided into small geographical areas called cells. Analog signals representing sounds and images are digitised in the device (phone, computer, tablet, etc), converted by an analog-todigital converter and transmitted as a stream of bits. A bit being, if you think back to your schooldays, what happens when you reduce numbers and letters to zeroes and ones (aka binary code), represented electronically by positive and negative electrical charges.\r\nThis stream of bits is then communicated between devices and a transmitter/receiver using radio waves. The transmitter/receivers are contained in the cellphone masts we are all familiar with, either in the form of metal scaffolding structures, or fake palm trees. Each tower transmits and receives only over a limited area around it, called a cell. The towers themselves are connected with the telephone network and the internet by a highbandwidth (ie fast) optical fiber or wireless connection.\r\nAs you move with your phone, your connection is automatically handed off to an adjacent cell or tower. 5G can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, compared to 4G ~ our current network ~ at only 100 000. Apart from being able to handle more devices 5G is supposed to be faster with higher download speeds.\r\nThis is achieved partly by using higher-frequency radio waves than what is currently in use. However, higherfrequency radio waves have a shorter range than the frequencies used by previous cell phone towers, so to ensure wide service, 5G networks operates on up to three frequency bands ~ low, medium and high.\r\nA 5G network will thus be composed of networks of these three different cells, each requiring different antennae, each giving a different ratio of download speed versus distance. 5G devices will connect to the network through the highest speed antenna within range at their location. So, if you are further away you will connect via the low frequency band as it has the largest reach.\r\nSo, 5G is designed to improve the speed of our networks ~ in some cases leading to a 10 gigabyte per second download speed ~ the equivalent of watching three and a half hours of high definition Netflix. It will also help take pressure off the current 4G LTE networks used by most carriers, which is becoming overburdened.\r\nWill 5G, or 4G for that matter, cause health problems? The answer is… maybe. The power of radio waves emitted from a cell phone tower decreases four times over as you move away from the tower. And this will apply in the same way to a tower with more antennae. So proximity to and the number of antennae in a tower is not a huge concern. Of greater concern than the radiation from a tower is that emitted by your cell phone itself.\r\nBut there’s more, namely the release of electromagnetic radiation. The main biological effect of this radiation is an increase in temperature. However, the power levels involved in mobile and wireless telecommunications are very small, involving at most temperature rises in tissue of a few tenths of a degree. Additionally, the amount of power ~ heat ~ a device is able to emit is regulated, and is the same for a 4G or 5G device.\r\nHowever, with the addition of medium and high frequency bands in 5G, this has an effect on the frequency of radiation. In 4G, the frequencies range between 4 to 6 gigahertz (GHz) ~ which is the unit used to measure frequency. In 5G, the current maximum frequency is 86GHz, considerably higher, and falling into the millimeter-wave range. But what is this actually? A photon is a particle representing electromagnetic radiation. Each photon carries energy proportional to the radiation frequency. So, because 5G has higher frequency, it will therefore also have higher energy. These energies are non-ionising which means the photon energy is not big enough to remove an electron from an atom or molecule. The sun, for example, emits four times more millimetre-waves (between 400-800 terahertz, tera being 1 000 giga.)\r\nIn fact, we already use items daily that emit millimetrewaves. The reverse parking sensors in your car emit up to 77GHz. A microwave emits between 3 and 30GHz. A Wi-Fi router emits up to 6GHz. Body scanners such as those used at airports emit, depending on their sophistication, up to 80GHz. Clearly, the decades-long risks of exposure are unknown because the technology has not been around long enough for prolonged study. And this is why the answer to the question “can 5G cause harm” is a maybe… but it is also a maybe for 4G and probably the other Gs too. And also wind turbines, red meat and prolonged exposure to the Kardashians.\r\nBut, what about smaller creatures such as bees? Will they be affected? Again, the answer is maybe…but unlikely, and it is clear more research needs to be done, because much of what has been done is unsophisticated, at best. For example, as far back as 2006, a Landau University researcher in Germany placed two digital enhanced cordless telecommunications stations (the docking station you put a cordless landline phone into) in two bees hives. He also left two hives untouched as a control.\r\nHe then trapped 25 bees at the entrance to each hive and released them 800m away from the hives, recording how many made their way home. The bees from the hives with docking stations built smaller combs and found it harder to come home. But, the researchers didn’t know if the bees they trapped and released had ever left the hive or if this was their first sojourn into the world ~ there was no way of proving the bees’ competence at wayfinding prior to the experiment. They also had no proof that it was the radiation emissions that halted combbuilding and not just the presence of a foreign object in their hive. Bees can be finicky and will be affected by any foreign object. For all we know, bees with an old shoe suddenly placed in their hive would build less comb.\r\nHoney bees have ferromagnetic crystals, or magnetite, in their abdomens, which act as magnetic sensors. Bees use this capacity for orientation and navigation. Research into the effects of telecommunication on bees’ internal magnetic receptors has been, well, inconclusive. Research conducted by the EU-funded Eklipse Project in 2018, found poor scientific evidence to back up claims that bees are affected by telecommunications. And, in those experiments that can be considered adequately conducted, there is little to no evidence that the presence of antennae, or the distance between hives and antenna has much effect on the swarm’s population size, reproduction capabilities or production efficiency.\r\nResearch into hives versus cell towers on two Aegean islands showed varying effect on the bees in relation to the antenna ~ and some effects were also contingent on other factors. Eklipse found that those studies that showed negative effects on the insects were lab-based experiments, putting the bees in unnatural situations (for example, testing the bees’ flight pattern when exposed to radiation at a height that a bee would likely never fly at and therefore not be exposed to).\r\nAs with humans, the long term effects of 5G on insects is unknown but appears at the outset to be low-risk. In fact, there are more immediate risks to bees ~ the use of pesticides, monoculture crops and certain invasive parasites ~ than 5G.\r\n', 'blog1.png', NULL, NULL, NULL),
(2, 1, 'The Importance of Forage For Bees', 'The availability of pollen and nectar from flowers, i.e., the forage, is at the very heart of keeping bees: no forage, no swarms, no bees, and no honey. Bees will simply vacate their hives and swarm off if moved into an area when there is little or no forage.\r\nForage comprises nectar for honey which is the carbohydrate, providing energy, and pollen their protein, for the sustenance of their bodies and water for their wellbeing.\r\nHouse bees, young bees and nurse bees consume nectar and pollen to which they add enzymes from their own digestive systems, to produce\r\nroyal jelly to feed to the very young developing larva and daily to their queen to maintain her egg-laying ability.\r\nThrough the seasons (and commencing with winter), there is not much about and the bees are surviving on their winter stocks from the previous season. There will be minimal flying, only to fetch water. But as the weather starts warming, the days lengthen and scout bees fly in search of forage. For example, on a certain early spring day a scout bee discovers pollen yielding plants two kilometers in an easterly direction from the hive.\r\nThe scout will return to the hive and with excited waggles she dances over the combs to alarm the other worker bees.\r\nThere are a variety of dances to convey the distance to the newly discovered pollen and nectar source, and the direction to an angle of the direct rays of the sun. These waggling dances vary from circular clockwise and then anti-clockwise, from figures of eight clockwise and anticlockwise and at different angles on the face of the combs on which they are dancing.\r\nInterested workers encircle this dancing bee and attend to the communication signals, while at the same time the dancing bee secrete from her mandibles a minute portion of the nectar of the plants that she has discovered to these workers, to convey the odour of the flowers from which she had gathered the pollen or nectar.\r\nSuppose the entrance of the hive faces north and 30 degrees east of north are the direct rays of the sun. Out of the hive, the foraging workers fly, take the angle to the sun and the distance as conveyed by the number and rapid succession waggles of the dancer.\r\nAfter flying the 2km distance for some minutes, their two very sensitive antennae locate the odour for which they are searching. They gather the pollen for which they came and a little nectar and return to the hive.\r\nOn arrival, they off-load the pollen into a pollen storage cell and then regurgitate the nectar to another worker bee while performing their waggle dance to convey their message to others.\r\nThroughout the days of the period of the pollen or nectar flow they daily gather until the flows are over, which might be for a week or up to 30 days.\r\nAs the swarm needs pollen, the bees search for and gather pollen and as the swarm needs nectar they gather nectar, but never nectar and pollen on the same foraging flight. When collecting pollen, the foraging bee will only visit the same flower species secreting the same pollen and not mix other pollen from another species of flower on the same gathering flight, and similarly with collecting nectar (which is why kinds of honey taste and look so different when not blended together into a commercially viable single large quantity for mass supermarket sale).\r\nWhen the spring pollen flow is being secreted by various flowers the bees do not seem to be choosy to prefer a type of pollen from a special source. Pollen is pollen and that is that but in the case of nectar, the bees are more selective. Should there be a variety of flowers secreting nectar at the same time, the bees will draw from the flowers with the higher sugar content in the nectar rather than spend valuable time taking nectar from a less concentrated sugar source.\r\nFor example, if a beekeeper places hives around a pumpkin field to pollinate the crop, but on an adjoining farm within about 2km away\r\nanother farmer plants buckwheat, the bees will fly to the buckwheat before they spend their time on the pumpkins and poor pollination of the pumpkin crop results. Although the buckwheat nectar makes honey that is dark and has an unpleasant musty flavour but\r\na large variety of minerals, it is greatly preferred by the bees.\r\nHow does pollination actually occur? Well, as a byproduct of nectar collection. The foraging worker bee delves deeply into the base of\r\nthe flower to suck up the nectar with her long probosci’s tongue, drawing up the nectar into her special carrying stomach, and when loaded\r\nshe returns to the hive.\r\nBut at the same time particles of pollen from the anthers of the flowers adhere to her hairy thorax and as she visits another flower of the same species the pollen rubs off on to the stamen of the next flower and completes the pollination of that flower.\r\nIn the beehive, she faces the recipient bee face to face and touches her antennae to her recipient’s antennae as a greeting and conversation of sorts as she regurgitates the nectar to a house bee or young bee, who passes it to another bee and again from other bees to others as a process of dehydrating the nectar. They also add enzymes from the hypopharynx glands in their heads which converts the sucrose sugar of the nectar to fructose and glucose sugars, the two principal sugars of honey (although honey contains up to nine other minor sugars).\r\nAfter the nectar is reduced to a thicker mass it is stored in the cells. At night or on rainy days when the bees are unable to forage, they fan with their wings at the entrance of the hives to create an outward draught, which draws off the excess moisture from the nectar until the moisture content is reduced to less than 19% and the cell is then capped with wax.\r\nA resident non-migratory strong swarm in the company of 15 other hives on a site of two good yielding periods of forage yielding flowers, will annually yield 20 to 25 kg of capped honey.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, place 30 swarms on the same site, and the average yield will be halved to 10 to 12 kg of capped honey as there is only that\r\nmuch nectar available within the reach of the swarms’ foraging radius.\r\nTherefore, in an area where there is a vast number of hobbyist beekeepers, or commercial beekeepers, overstocking holding sites\r\nawaiting the following pollination contract periods, the honey yields on good swarms can be reduced to an average of 6 to 8 kg per hive, which is hardly enough to carry the swarm through the winter dearth period, and the bees will starve or abscond to abandon the overstocked\r\narea.\r\nTherefore, good beekeeping is all about ensuring the forage to sustain the swarms and it should be stressed that, to advance beekeeping, it is not that additional number of beekeepers are required but that mass planting of good, correct, sustainable supporting forage yielding plants is necessary.\r\n', 'blog2.png', NULL, NULL, NULL),
(3, 1, 'Colony Collapse Disorder: Another Climate Change Effect', 'Is it too late for bees or are the bees too late? Well, both. Bees are certainly dying in droves, in part due to climate change, says a new study commissioned by the Daily Maverick and published by the Institute of Climate Change at Wits University. But, a lesser known threat is just as worrying, says the study: changing temperatures in southern Africa are causing plants, including food crops, to flower at different times,\r\nWhich throws bees off their regular pollinating schedule. “What is often missed is the sheer scale of the industry of pollinators, and just how much they contribute to our well-being.” Every third bite of food was produced by the activities of pollinators. Out of 115 foods\r\ncrops studied in a global assessment, 87 depend to some degree upon animal pollination and 13 are entirely reliant upon animal pollinators. Estimates suggest that pollination by insects underpins US$361 billion in crop production worldwide. The deciduous fruit industry\r\nin the Western Cape alone is worth R9 800 million per year and is heavily reliant on pollination services from managed honeybees. Pollinators have been found to be declining globally. Bee colonies undergo Colony Collapse Disorder, when the majority of worker bees in a bee colony disappear. The causes can be multiple, and include habitat change, pesticides, climate change\r\nAnd pathogens ~ and very likely, the interactions among them, says the study. “Pollinators also play a critical role in natural ecosystems.\r\nBy moving from one flower to the next in search of nectar and pollen, they fertilize subsequent generations of plants and keep the gene pool healthy.” Worldwide there are many kinds of bees and they form part of a veritable army of mainly insect pollinators that are active across the globe. The study believes part of the solution may lie in citizen science, where members of the public collect scientifically useful data. “Some of the best evidence we have that pollinators are thrown off their regular pollination timing comes from records collected by amateur\r\nEnthusiasts, measuring when plants flower and when butterflies start flying, each season over the years. Citizens can monitor the extent of the issue, as scientists simply do not have the capacity to do so comprehensively.” \r\n', 'blog3.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL);
